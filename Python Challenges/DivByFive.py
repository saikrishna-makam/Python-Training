#Exercise 6: Given a list of numbers, Iterate it and print only those numbers which are divisible of 5

listItems = [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]
resultList = [val for val in listItems if val % 5 == 0]

print("Divisible of 5 in a list")
for i in resultList:
    print(i)

#Expected Output:

#Given list is  [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]
#Divisible of 5 in a list
#10
#20
#55
