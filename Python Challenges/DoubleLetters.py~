#Problem Title: Double letters

#Problem:

#The goal of this challenge is to analyze a string to check if it contains two of the same letter in a row. For example, the string 
#"hello" has l twice in a row, while the string "nono" does not have two identical letters in a row.

#Define a function named double_letters that takes a single parameter. The parameter is a string. Your function must return True if 
#there are two identical letters in a row in the string, and False otherwise.

#Solution:

def double_letters(string):
    return len([True for a,b in zip(string, string[1:]) if a == b]) > 0
    
print(double_letters("hello"))
print(double_letters("nono"))

#Output:
#True
#False
