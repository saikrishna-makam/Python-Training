#Exercise 10: Given a two list of numbers create a new list such that new list should contain only odd numbers from the first list 
#and even numbers from the second list

list1 =  [10, 20, 23, 11, 17]
list2 = [13, 43, 24, 36, 12]
newList = []
for a, b in zip(list1, list2):
    if a % 2 != 0:
       newList.append(a)
    if b % 2 == 0: 
        newList.append(b)

print("Result List is", newList)


#Expected Output:

#list1 =  [10, 20, 23, 11, 17]
#list2 = [13, 43, 24, 36, 12]

#Result List is [23, 24, 11, 36, 17, 12]
