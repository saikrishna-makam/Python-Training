*What are different ways to get the indices of the list element.

- The best and easiest way to find the index of the particular element from iterable object is to use built-in index() method of 
list. The index() method returns the index of first occurrence of element.

- The other way is to iterate over list using naive approach and if element is found then append the index of element in list. 
Finally print that list to get all the occurence indices of the list element.

- We can also use list comprehension to get the indices of the list element.

- filter() method can also be used to filter the list and find the indices of the list element. We can set the element matching 
condition in filter and for those elements the condition returns true boolean value, only those elements indices will be appended 
to the list and returned.
