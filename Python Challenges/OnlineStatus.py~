#Problem title: Online status
#Problem:
#The aim of this challenge is, given a dictionary of people's online status, to count the number of people who are online.

#For example, consider the following dictionary:

#statuses = {
#    "Alice": "online",
#    "Bob": "offline",
#    "Eve": "online",
#}
#In this case, the number of people online is 2.

#Write a function named online_count that takes one parameter. The parameter is a dictionary that maps from strings of names to the 
#string "online" or "offline", as seen above.

#Your function should return the number of people who are online.

#Solution:

def online_count(dict_status):
    return len(list(filter((lambda key: dict_status[key] == "online"), dict_status)))
    
statuses = {
    "Alice": "online",
    "Bob": "offline",
    "Eve": "online",
}

print(online_count(statuses))

#Output:
#2
