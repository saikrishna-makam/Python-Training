#Problem Title: Custom zip

#Problem:

#The built-in zip function "zips" two lists. Write your own implementation of this function.

#Define a function named zap. The function takes two parameters, a and b. These are lists.

#Your function should return a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain one item from the a list and one from b.

#You may assume a and b have equal lengths.

#If you don't get it, think of a zipper.

#For example:

#zap(
#    [0, 1, 2, 3],
#    [5, 6, 7, 8]
#)
#Should return:

#[(0, 5),
# (1, 6),
# (2, 7),
# (3, 8)]

#Solution:

def zap(list1, list2):
    return [(list1[i], list2[i]) for i in range(0, len(list1))]
